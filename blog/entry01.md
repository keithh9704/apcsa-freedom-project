### Content 
Coming into my 3rd year of this course, researching a tool with more freedom that is either outside of java or with java was more easier finding tools that I have a good fit for me. At first I chose godot, I came to the realization that this tool doesn't have that much code into it. It's more about creating a sprite and putting it into the correct directory so the sprite moves correctly.

I based my first [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) but I didn't stop researching there. I had another tool called gDevelop which also caught my eye. This tool had a website playground I can tinker around with, without having to download an app like godot. Instantly I thought I want to switch to this tool because of how more beginner friendly it was compared to godot. Although it was really similar to godot it had a section that godot doesn't have (from when I was tinkering). There is a file where you can put your actions on a sprite and applying sprite sheets was really easy to implement.

You can change how fast or slow you want the animation and there is a preview button next to it. With the tool In mind I want to make a game where the choices the player makes impact what they encounter.
### Engineering Design Process
I am at the first stage of EDP (Engineering Design Process). The stage is defining the problem. The problem is that many people don't know that sometimes their actions can lead to consequences they never thought can happen. With this game, I would like to create a game that seems friendly at first since you can do anything you want. Then suddenly you realize the actions you did at the beginning either give you a sigh of relief or you feel guilty you did those things. 
### Skills 
I learned to enhance my consideration and how to learn skills.
#### Consideration
Although I found a tool like godot that perfectly fits with my interest, I didn't stop there and considered another tool like Gdevelop to test out. Eventually when testing both of them out, I actually liked Gdevelop more than godot. If I didn't give myself a chance to tinker with Gdevelop then I wouldn't have found the perfect tool for me.
#### How to learn
Jumping between godot to Gdevelop, I looked up many youtube videos explaining the basics of both tools. Instead of just watching the video and trying to "learn" from there, I go step by step with the video and find out how this software works.
### Next Steps
Now finalizing my tool I absolutely want to commit to. I am excited about the things I can learn while using this tool as I go into the second stage of EDP, researching the problem.
