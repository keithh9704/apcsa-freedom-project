  - [ ] Create one scene that is sad and full of guilt (deadline: 4/13/26)
    - [ ] Have text while doing parkour jumps about how making this choice is a bad choice to make 
#### Beyond MVP
- [ ] For the Enemy sprite make it so that the player reset to the beginning of the game
- [ ] Add a scene where you can change your mind before entering the corresponding scene the player choosed
  - [ ] Put two of the sprites that changes the scene to the corresponding choice the player choosed to make them choose again.
- [ ] Make it so the happy and joy scene has a easier time doing parkour jumps and the sad and guilt scene have a harder time doing parkour jumps
  - [ ] if the player failed the parkour jump, instead of going back to the beginning they get a retry going back to the current scene they are at.
